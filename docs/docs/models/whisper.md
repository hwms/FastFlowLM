## 🧩 Model Card: [whisper-large-v3-turbo](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo)

- **Type:** Speech-to-Text (ASR: Automatic Speech Recognition)
- **Think:** No
- **Tool Calling Support:** No
- **Base Model:** [openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo)
- **Max Context Length:** NA
- **Default Context Length:** NA

▶️ Run with FastFlowLM in PowerShell:  

> The ASR model must be used with an LLM (loaded concurrently) in CLI Mode.
> The ASR model can be used as an independent ASR model in Server Mode (flm v0.9.21 and after).

### CLI Mode   

Start with ASR enabled: 

Load the ASR model (whisper-v3:turbo) in the background, with concurrent LLM loading (gemma3:4b).
```shell
flm run gemma3:4b --asr 1 
```
or
```shell
flm run gemma3:4b -a 1 
```

Then, type (replace `filename.mp3` with your audio file path):
```shell
/input "path\to\audio_sample.mp3" summarize it
```

### Server Mode 

Start with ASR enabled: 

- Load the ASR model (whisper-v3:turbo) in the background, with concurrent LLM loading (gemma3:4b).
```shell
flm serve gemma3:4b --asr 1 
```
or
```shell
flm serve gemma3:4b -a 1 
```

- Load the ASR model (whisper-v3:turbo) as a standalone ASR model.
```shell
flm serve --asr 1 
```
or
```shell
flm serve -a 1 
```

Send audio to `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` via any OpenAI Client or Open WebUI.

Set `response_format=verbose_json` to receive `duration`, timestamped
`segments`, the raw model `no_speech_probability`, and
`chunk_no_speech_probabilities` in addition to the transcript text. Segment
timestamps are clipped to the real input duration, not Whisper's padded
30-second window.

> The Q4 NPU model's raw `<|nospeech|>` probability is diagnostic output, not a
> production silence gate. Use an external VAD before transcription when false
> speech on silent or sparse audio must be prevented.

**Example 1**: OpenAI Client

```python
# Import the official OpenAI Python SDK (FastFlowLM mirrors the OpenAI API schema)
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the client to point at your local FastFlowLM server
# - base_url: FastFlowLM's local OpenAI-compatible REST endpoint
# - api_key: Dummy token; FastFlowLM typically doesn't enforce auth, but the client requires a string
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://127.0.0.1:52625/v1",  # FastFlowLM local API endpoint
    api_key="flm",                         # Placeholder key
)

# Open the audio file in binary mode and create a transcription request
# - model: name of the speech-to-text model exposed by FLM (e.g., "whisper-v3")
# - file: file-like object pointing to your audio
with open("audio.mp3", "rb") as f:
    resp = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
        model="whisper-v3",
        file=f,
    )

# Print the transcribed text returned by the server
print(resp.text)
```

**Example 2**: Open WebUI

- Follow Open WebUI setup [guide](https://fastflowlm.com/docs/instructions/server/webui/).
- In the bottom-left corner, click User icon, then select Settings.
- In the bottom panel, open Admin Settings.
- In the left sidebar, navigate to Audio.
- Set Speech-to-Text Engine to OpenAI.
- Enter:
> API Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:52625/v1` (Open WebUI Desktop) or `http://host.docker.internal:52625/v1` (Open WebUI in Docker)   
> API KEY: flm (any value works)    
> STT Model: whisper-large-v3-turbo (type in the model name; can be different)    
- Save the setting.
- You're ready to upload audio files! (Choose an LLM to load and use concurrently)
